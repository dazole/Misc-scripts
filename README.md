# Misc-scripts
Misc scripts I write

- ldap_chkaccess: Performs ldap queries against AD to check if a user has
  access to the server the script is run on.  Requires pam_ldap and pam_access.
  Similar to "vastool user checkaccess $account".

- git_hooks:  Git hooks I use with gitlab.

- AD_unix_enable: Unix-enable a user via powershell.
